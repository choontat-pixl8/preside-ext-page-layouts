# Preside page layouts extension

The purpose of this extension is to provide a methodolgy of creating re-usable page layout templates for your Preside applications.

## Why this is needed

Coldbox already comes with a general *layouts* concept. However, these layouts are best used for a whole *site* layout. Often-times, a site might have additional *page* layouts such as two column vs one column, etc. and the current situation means that the HTML for these will be created over and over again.
